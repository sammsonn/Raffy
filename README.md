Raffy is a customer service chatbot created to facilitate quick and easy access to the information users need. Through a simple interaction, Raffy answers questions related to services and products present on the Raiffeisen Bank website.

Raffy provides real-time interaction with the user, the use of artificial intelligence to facilitate site navigation and quickly find the desired information, thus eliminating the user's effort to search. In addition, it provides a pleasant experience designed to capture attention and provide personalized support.

Raffy's AI performs multiple cataloging of users, even during the conversation, in order to transmit to an appropriate agent. Thus, we implement a large number of KnowledgeBases to provide precise information, in the shortest possible time. (Ex.: The user is looking for information from the natural person / legal person area)

Raffy is built strictly for the information present on the Raiffeisen bank website, without having permission to provide information about other companies or domains. (Ex.: We don't want a user to ask Raffy for a python script, and Raffy actually give it to him)
